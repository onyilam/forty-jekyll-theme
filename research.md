					<h3>Advertisers Capture: Evidence from Hong Kong</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This paper provides evidence that non-coercive political pressure on the media can be substantial. It shows that advertisers in Hong Kong engage in politically-induced advertising boycott on media that adopts a political stance which is against the mainland Chinese government policy. Using daily advertising data between 2010 and 2014, I exploit the exogenous variation of the occurrence of political events and their intensity to examine to what degree political salience affects firms' decisions to place ads in a pro-Democracy (as opposed to pro-Beijing) newspaper, particularly so among Beijing-friendly firms. I estimate that the pro-Democracy newspaper suffered from an ad revenue loss equivalent to 21.9% of its total advertising revenue in 2014 due to political reasons.</p>

					<h3>Measuring Subjectivity in History Textbooks </h3>
				</header>
				<p>History textbooks provide a lens through which students view the nation's past. Government, especially that of authoritarian regime, has an incentive to present biased content in the history textbook to influence students' political views. This paper considers the problem of measuring subjectivity for history textbooks used in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Using sentiment analysis, I find empirical evidence that history textbooks in mainland China exhibit stronger degree of subjectivity than history textbooks used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Specifically, the paper measures the adjective content in the textbook, the ratio of positive to negative words in specific time periods in history and employs word embedding method that measures distance from political entities of interest such as the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

					<h3>Celebrities Capture: Evidence from Weibo</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The advent of the digital age has created both challenges and opportunities for au- thoritarian regime. This paper shows that popular Chinese celebrities, especially those from the entertainment industry, are more likely to express patriotic sentiment on Weibo, a Twitter-like social network tool in China than less popular ones. The tendency to post patriotic messages is also highly correlated with the intensity of government promotion of the celebrity. To understand the empirical findings, we propose a simple model to show that dependency on government media to secure economic interest aligns the celebrities interest with that of the state.</p>

					<h3>Preventing Juvenile Interactions with the Criminal Justice System</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Juvenile offense can have severe detrimental effects on various life outcomes. Study has found that that early childhood intervention programs help to reduce future delinquency (Reynolds et al. 2001, Zigler et al. 1992), suggesting the benefit of identify at-risk children at a early stage. The current early warning system in the Milwaukee Public School is a heuristic approach based largely on teachers' intuition and experience. In this paper, we describe our work with the ShareData platform in the city of Milwaukee to develop a machine learning model to predict which students are at risk of interacting with the criminal justice system and the protective factors. Our approach significantly outperforms the heuristic method, identifying the same number of at-risk students while only flagging 33% as many students. Our work also sheds light on features related to family characteristics, and school performance that are predictive of juvenile interaction with the criminal justice system.</p>
