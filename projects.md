					<h3>Uniform or Not: An Image Classifier</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is the first neural network I trained using 1983 images of individuals in uniform, and 1697 of random images. The model achieves 90% accuracy, which is not great for production but decent on my first foray into neural networks. The motivation comes from wanting to understand whether certain media outlets are more likely to post pictures of individuals in uniform to emphasize a certain viewpoint. The link details my experience using Keras, and a little tool for you to upload an image to see how the model works. </p>

					<h3>Assessing Demographic Shock to Economic Recovery</h3>
				</header>
				<p> This projects investigates the effect of a sudden demographic shock on intensity of economic activity. Demographics and macroeconomics interact and evolve in complementarity with each other and it is usually very difficult to disentangle the causal effect of demography on the economy. Studying Japan after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011 gives us this opportunity. We use the night light emission data to estimate the regionâ€™s economic recovery relative to year 2010. Our result suggests that death rate due to the disaster affects the subsequent economic recovery. The result is significant to 0.1% level. Furthermore, we found some evidence that the death rate of the elderly (65+) is insignificant in explaining recovery once we control for the 15-64 age group. Overall, demographic shock appears to only have a very transient effect on recovery.</p>
