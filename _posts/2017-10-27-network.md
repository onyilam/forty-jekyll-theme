This is the first neural network I trained using 1983 images of individuals in uniform, and 1697 of random images. The model achieves 88% accuracy, which is not great for production but decent on my first foray into neural networks.

The motivation of this project comes from wanting to understand whether certain media outlets are more likely to post pictures of individuals in uniform (firefighter, military or police) to emphasize the authority's viewpoint. I use the tool to classify the images posted on the instagram accounts of ABC (@abc) CNN (@cnn) and  Fox News (@foxnews). 

I largely follow  <a href = "https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html">this tutorial </a> on binary classification for the model building. Our approach relies on leveraging a network pre-trained on a large dataset. Specifically, I emplied the  InceptionV3 architecture
pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. 


Curiously, the model performs worse when I tried to fine-tune" the last convolutional block. 

The link at the bottom allows you  you to upload an image to see how the model works.
