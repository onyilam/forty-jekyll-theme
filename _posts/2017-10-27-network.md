The motivation of this project comes from wanting to understand whether certain media outlets are more likely to post pictures of individuals in uniform (firefighter, military or police) to emphasize the authority's viewpoint. I use the tool to classify the images posted on the instagram accounts of ABC (@abc) CNN (@cnn) and  Fox News (@foxnews). The training sample consists of pictures scraped from the instagram accounts of US Army (@usarmy), US Police (@uspolice), and a generic search of pictures from Flickr. To improve mdoel accuracy, I also supplement the not-uniform class with pictures from ESPN (@espn) to help distinguis sports uniform from government uniforms. 

This is the first neural network I trained using X images of individuals in uniform, and X of random images. The model achieves 88% accuracy, which is not great for production but decent on my first foray into neural networks.

I scraped the images on XXX, and collected 

I largely follow  <a href = "https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html">this tutorial </a> on binary classification for the model building. Our approach relies on leveraging a network pre-trained on a large dataset. Specifically, I emplied the  InceptionV3 architecture
pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. 


Couple things I learned:

1. Curiously, the model performs worse when I tried to fine-tune" the last convolutional block. 

2. I apply the models on serval test images and found that the model does a good job in recognizing pictures without human but have more trouble separating individuals wearing suits vs individuals wearing uniforms.
