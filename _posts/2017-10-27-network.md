This is the first neural network I trained using 1983 images of individuals in uniform, and 1697 of random images. The model achieves 89% accuracy, which is not great for production but decent on my first foray into neural networks. The motivation comes from wanting to understand whether certain media outlets are more likely to post pictures of individuals in uniform (firefighter, military or police) to emphasize the authority's viewpoint. I use the tool to classify the images posted on the instagram accounts of ABC (@abc) CNN (@cnn) and  Fox News (@foxnews). Given that the model only achieves 89% accuracy, this means that there is a 11% margin of error. 

I largely follow  <a href = "https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html">this tutorial </a> on binary classification for the model building. 


The link at the bottom allows you  you to upload an image to see how the model works.
